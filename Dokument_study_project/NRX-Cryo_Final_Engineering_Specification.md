## 1. Overall Geometry and Core Structure

### 1.1 3D Cylindrical Layout

The NRX-Cryo Cylindrical Heat Exchanger is designed as a cylindrical structure with an embedded TPMS-based gyroid architecture. The gyroid structure provides an optimal balance between surface area, flow characteristics, and mechanical strength, making it ideal for cryogenic heat exchange applications.

The cylindrical geometry allows for efficient integration with existing propulsion systems while maximizing the heat transfer surface area within a compact volume. The gyroid architecture creates a continuous, self-supporting network of channels that enables efficient heat transfer between the solid structure and the fluid medium.

### 1.2 Final Confirmed Dimensions

| Parameter | Value | Unit |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Inner Radius | 77.03 | mm |
| Outer Radius | 84.14 | mm |
| Wall Thickness | 7.11 | mm |
| Total Height/Length | 300.0 | mm |
| Total Volume | 1,324,212 | mm³ |
| Gyroid Cell Size | 7.5 | mm |
| Gyroid Wall Thickness | 0.3 | mm |

### 1.3 Structural Boundaries

The heat exchanger is bounded by:

- Inner cylindrical boundary at r = 77.03 mm
- Outer cylindrical boundary at r = 84.14 mm
- Bottom planar boundary at z = 0 mm
- Top planar boundary at z = 300.0 mm

A smooth transition region is implemented at all boundaries to ensure manufacturability and structural integrity. The transition width is set to 1.0 mm from each boundary, creating a gradual blend between the gyroid structure and the boundary surfaces.

### 1.4 Gyroid Architecture

The core structure utilizes a gyroid-based Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) architecture. The gyroid is a minimal surface with triple periodicity that divides space into two intertwined but separate labyrinths.

Key characteristics of the gyroid architecture:

- Continuous, self-supporting structure without intersections
- High surface-to-volume ratio for efficient heat transfer
- Smooth curvature that minimizes flow resistance
- Balanced mechanical properties in all directions
- Manufacturability via additive manufacturing techniques

The gyroid structure is mathematically defined using an implicit function where the surface is represented by the isosurface G(x,y,z) = 0. The solid region is defined by G(x,y,z) < 0, and the fluid region by G(x,y,z) > 0.

### 1.5 Frequency Gradient

A key innovation in this design is the implementation of a spatially varying frequency gradient that optimizes the gyroid cell size based on radial position. The frequency varies according to a power law with exponent α = 0.3:

f(r) = f_min + (f_0 - f_min) × ((R_outer - r)/(R_outer - R_inner))^α

Where:
- f_0 = 2π/cell_size × 0.8378 = 0.7019 rad/mm (reference frequency)
- f_min = f_0 × 0.1 = 0.0702 rad/mm (minimum frequency)
- α = 0.3 (frequency gradient exponent)

This gradient creates smaller cells near the inner radius and larger cells near the outer radius, optimizing flow characteristics and heat transfer efficiency throughout the structure.

## 2. Helical Cooling Channels

### 2.1 Channel Configuration

The NRX-Cryo Cylindrical Heat Exchanger incorporates a system of helical cooling channels designed to efficiently transport the supercritical helium coolant through the structure. These channels are arranged in a precise configuration to maximize cooling efficiency while maintaining structural integrity.

#### 2.1.1 Total Number and Arrangement

- **Total Number of Tubes**: 48
- **Arrangement**: 4 concentric radial rings
- **Tubes per Ring**: 12 (48 ÷ 4 = 12)

#### 2.1.2 Radial Distribution

The 48 tubes are distributed across 4 concentric radial rings positioned between the inner radius (77.03 mm) and outer radius (84.14 mm) of the cylindrical structure. Based on the implementation in the code, the tubes are positioned along a helical path with a diameter equal to the inner diameter of the heat exchanger (2 × 77.03 mm = 154.06 mm).

The radial positions of the tubes are determined by the coil diameter and the angular offsets of each tube. The tubes in each ring are evenly distributed around the circumference with specific angular offsets.

### 2.2 Tube Positioning

#### 2.2.1 Angular Offset

The tubes are positioned with angular offsets calculated as:

φᵢ = 2π × i / n_tubes

Where:
- φᵢ is the angular offset for tube i
- i ranges from 0 to 47 (for 48 tubes)
- n_tubes = 48

This results in an angular spacing of 30° between tubes in the same ring (360° ÷ 12 = 30°).

#### 2.2.2 Helical Parameters

- **Number of Turns**: 9.5
- **Helix Pitch**: 31.58 mm (300 mm ÷ 9.5)
- **Tube Radius**: 2.0 mm

The parametric equation for the helical path of each tube is:

x = (coil_diameter/2) × cos(t + φᵢ)
y = (coil_diameter/2) × sin(t + φᵢ)
z = (pitch × t) / (2π)

Where:
- t is the parametric variable (equivalent to the angular position)
- φᵢ is the angular offset for tube i
- coil_diameter = 2 × inner_radius = 154.06 mm
- pitch = 31.58 mm

### 2.3 Non-Intersection and Manufacturability

#### 2.3.1 Non-Intersection Verification

The design ensures that all tubes are non-intersecting through careful positioning and sizing. The angular offsets and radial distribution prevent any tube from intersecting with another, which is critical for maintaining separate flow paths and structural integrity.

The minimum distance between any two tubes is maintained above a threshold that ensures manufacturability. This is achieved through the precise angular spacing and the helical path parameters.

#### 2.3.2 Manufacturability Constraints

The following manufacturability constraints are enforced in the design:

- **Minimum Wall Thickness**: 0.3 mm (between gyroid structure elements)
- **Minimum Distance Between Tubes**: > 4.0 mm (2 × tube radius)
- **Minimum Distance from Tube to Boundary**: > 2.0 mm

These constraints ensure that the structure can be successfully manufactured using Selective Laser Melting (SLM) or similar additive manufacturing processes without compromising structural integrity or flow characteristics.

### 2.4 Tube Specifications

#### 2.4.1 Dimensions

- **Tube Outer Diameter**: 4.0 mm (2 × radius)
- **Tube Inner Diameter**: Not explicitly specified, determined by wall thickness
- **Tube Length**: Approximately 2,990 mm per tube (calculated from helical path)
- **Total Tube Length**: Approximately 143,520 mm (48 tubes)

#### 2.4.2 Material Properties

The tubes are integrated with the gyroid structure and share the same material properties:

- **Material**: AlSi10Mg (aluminum alloy commonly used in SLM)
- **Thermal Conductivity**: 120.0 W/(m·K)
- **Density**: 2,670.0 kg/m³
- **Specific Heat**: 890.0 J/(kg·K)

These properties ensure efficient heat transfer between the coolant and the structure while maintaining the necessary mechanical strength for cryogenic applications.

## 3. Coolant Flow and Function

### 3.1 Cooling Medium

The NRX-Cryo Cylindrical Heat Exchanger is designed to use supercritical helium as the cooling medium. Supercritical helium is selected for its exceptional thermal properties at cryogenic temperatures, making it ideal for high-performance aerospace applications.

#### 3.1.1 Coolant Properties

- **Medium**: Supercritical Helium
- **Phase**: Supercritical (beyond critical point)
- **Operating Temperature Range**: 5-20K
- **Operating Pressure**: >2.3 bar (above critical pressure)

Supercritical helium offers several advantages for this application:
- High thermal conductivity
- Low viscosity
- No phase change during operation
- Excellent heat transfer characteristics
- Chemical inertness

### 3.2 Flow Direction and Entry/Exit Points

#### 3.2.1 Flow Path

Based on the design implementation, the coolant flow follows a specific path through the heat exchanger:

1. **Entry Point**: The coolant enters at the bottom (z = 0) of the cylindrical structure
2. **Flow Direction**: The coolant flows through the helical cooling channels in the axial direction (along the z-axis)
3. **Exit Point**: The coolant exits at the top (z = 300 mm) of the cylindrical structure

#### 3.2.2 Channel Configuration

The 48 helical cooling channels are arranged in 4 concentric rings with 12 tubes per ring. The coolant flows in parallel through these channels, maintaining a consistent flow direction from bottom to top.

#### 3.2.3 Inlet/Outlet Configuration

- **Inlet Configuration**: The 48 tube inlets are positioned at the bottom face of the cylindrical structure
- **Outlet Configuration**: The 48 tube outlets are positioned at the top face of the cylindrical structure
- **Inlet/Outlet Extension**: 20.0 mm extension regions are provided at both inlet and outlet for proper flow development and connection to external systems

### 3.3 Thermal Behavior

#### 3.3.1 Heat Transfer Mechanism

The heat exchanger operates on a counter-flow principle, where the coolant flow direction is opposite to the heat flow direction:

1. **Heat Source**: External heat enters from the outer surface of the cylindrical structure
2. **Heat Path**: Heat conducts through the gyroid structure toward the inner core
3. **Coolant Interaction**: The supercritical helium flowing through the helical channels absorbs heat from the gyroid structure
4. **Heat Sink**: The heated coolant carries the thermal energy away from the system

#### 3.3.2 Thermal Gradient

The design incorporates a radial thermal gradient:
- Higher temperatures at the outer radius
- Lower temperatures at the inner radius
- Gradual temperature transition through the gyroid structure

#### 3.3.3 Thermal Performance Characteristics

The heat exchanger is designed to achieve the following thermal performance:

- **Heat Transfer Coefficient**: Enhanced by the gyroid structure's high surface area
- **Thermal Efficiency**: Optimized by the frequency gradient that creates smaller cells near the inner radius
- **Flow Distribution**: Balanced across all 48 channels for uniform cooling
- **Pressure Drop**: Minimized by the smooth curvature of the gyroid structure and helical channels

### 3.4 Flow Parameters

#### 3.4.1 Flow Rate

The system is designed to accommodate a range of flow rates depending on the specific cooling requirements. The optimal flow rate should be determined based on the heat load and desired temperature differential.

#### 3.4.2 Pressure Characteristics

- **Inlet Pressure**: Determined by the supercritical helium supply system
- **Pressure Drop**: Calculated based on flow rate, channel geometry, and fluid properties
- **Outlet Pressure**: Must remain above the critical pressure of helium (2.3 bar)

#### 3.4.3 Flow Regime

The flow through the helical channels is designed to be in the laminar or transitional regime to balance heat transfer efficiency with pressure drop considerations. The Reynolds number will vary based on the specific operating conditions.

## 4. Integration with Gyroid Core

### 4.1 Structural Integration

The NRX-Cryo Cylindrical Heat Exchanger features a novel integration between the TPMS-based gyroid core and the helical cooling channels. This integration is designed to maximize heat transfer efficiency while maintaining structural integrity and manufacturability.

#### 4.1.1 Embedding Method

The helical cooling tubes are fully embedded within the gyroid structure, creating a unified, continuous body with embedded hollow channels. This approach offers several advantages:

- Eliminates the need for separate tube manufacturing and assembly
- Maximizes thermal contact between coolant and gyroid structure
- Ensures structural integrity by avoiding mechanical joints
- Simplifies manufacturing through a single-piece design
- Reduces thermal resistance at interfaces

#### 4.1.2 Spatial Relationship

The 48 helical cooling tubes are distributed in 4 concentric rings throughout the cylindrical domain. The tubes traverse through the gyroid structure, creating a complex but optimized thermal network. The gyroid structure fills the space between the tubes, providing both structural support and thermal conduction pathways.

### 4.2 Mathematical Integration

#### 4.2.1 Scalar Field Merging

The integration between the gyroid structure and helical tubes is achieved through a mathematical merging of their respective scalar fields:

F(x, y, z) = max(|G(x, y, z)| - t, -H(x, y, z))

Where:
- F(x, y, z) is the final scalar field
- G(x, y, z) is the gyroid scalar field
- H(x, y, z) is the helical tubes distance field
- t is the wall thickness parameter (0.3 mm)

This merging strategy creates a continuous printable body with embedded hollow channels. The isosurface F(x, y, z) = 0 defines the boundary of the solid structure.

#### 4.2.2 Gyroid Scalar Field

The gyroid scalar field is defined as:

G(r, θ, z) = sin(f(r) · r · cos(θ)) · cos(f(r) · r · sin(θ)) + 
             sin(f(r) · r · sin(θ)) · cos(f(r) · z) + 
             sin(f(r) · z) · cos(f(r) · r · cos(θ))

Where f(r) is the frequency gradient function that varies with radial position.

#### 4.2.3 Helical Tubes Distance Field

The helical tubes are represented by a signed distance field H(x, y, z), which gives the minimum distance from any point (x, y, z) to the nearest tube surface. The distance field is negative inside the tubes and positive outside.

For each tube i (where i ranges from 0 to 47):
1. Calculate the parametric equation for the helical path
2. Compute the minimum distance from point (x, y, z) to the helical path
3. Subtract the tube radius (2.0 mm) from this distance

The final distance field H(x, y, z) is the minimum of these distances across all 48 tubes.

### 4.3 Wall Thickness Control

#### 4.3.1 Gyroid Wall Thickness

The wall thickness of the gyroid structure is controlled by the parameter t = 0.3 mm in the wall thickness function:

T(x, y, z) = |G(x, y, z)| - t

This creates a gyroid structure with approximately uniform wall thickness throughout the domain.

#### 4.3.2 Tube-Gyroid Interface

The wall thickness between the helical tubes and the gyroid structure is implicitly controlled by the scalar field merging function. The mathematical formulation ensures that there is always sufficient material between the tubes and the gyroid channels to maintain structural integrity.

#### 4.3.3 Minimum Wall Thickness Enforcement

The design enforces a minimum wall thickness of 0.3 mm throughout the structure. This is achieved through:

1. The wall thickness parameter in the gyroid function
2. The tube radius and spacing in the helical cooling coil function
3. The mathematical merging method that preserves wall thickness

### 4.4 Boundary Transitions

#### 4.4.1 Transition Function

A smooth transition is implemented at the domain boundaries to ensure manufacturability and structural integrity:

B(r) = 0.5 · (1 + tanh((d_inner - d_boundary) / d_transition)) · 
       0.5 · (1 + tanh((d_outer - d_boundary) / d_transition))

Where:
- d_inner is the distance from the inner boundary
- d_outer is the distance from the outer boundary
- d_boundary is the distance from boundary for transition (1.0 mm)
- d_transition is the width of transition region (1.0 mm)

#### 4.4.2 Final Field Integration

The boundary transition is applied to the combined field:

F_final(x, y, z) = F(x, y, z) · B(r)

This ensures smooth transitions at all boundaries while maintaining the integrity of the internal structure.

## 5. Mathematical Consistency and Orientation

### 5.1 Coordinate System

#### 5.1.1 Axis Orientation

The NRX-Cryo Cylindrical Heat Exchanger design uses a consistent right-handed coordinate system with the following orientation:

- **Z-axis**: Vertical axis aligned with the cylinder's central axis
- **X-axis**: Horizontal axis
- **Y-axis**: Horizontal axis perpendicular to X
- **Origin**: Located at the center of the bottom face of the cylinder

This coordinate system is maintained consistently throughout all mathematical formulations, simulations, and generation logic.

#### 5.1.2 Cylindrical Coordinates

For the cylindrical domain, the following coordinate mapping is used:

- **r**: Radial distance from the Z-axis
- **θ**: Angular position in the XY-plane (counterclockwise from X-axis)
- **z**: Height along the Z-axis

The conversion between Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates follows the standard relations:
- x = r · cos(θ)
- y = r · sin(θ)
- z = z
- r = √(x² + y²)
- θ = atan2(y, x)

### 5.2 Mathematical Formulation Principles

#### 5.2.1 Continuous Field Approach

The entire geometry is defined using continuous scalar fields without discrete operations. This approach ensures:

- No masking operations
- No boolean operations
- No artificial clipping
- No conditional visibility

The geometry is fully defined by the isosurface F(x, y, z) = 0, where F is the combined scalar field.

#### 5.2.2 Field Blending

Field blending is achieved through continuous mathematical operations:

1. **Gyroid Field**: G(r, θ, z) defined by trigonometric functions
2. **Wall Thickness**: T(r, θ, z) = |G(r, θ, z)| - t
3. **Helical Tubes**: H(x, y, z) defined as a distance field
4. **Combined Field**: F(x, y, z) = max(T(r, θ, z), -H(x, y, z))
5. **Boundary Transition**: F_final(x, y, z) = F(x, y, z) · B(r)

This approach ensures smooth transitions between different geometric features and maintains mathematical consistency throughout the model.

### 5.3 Gyroid Mathematical Formulation

#### 5.3.1 Standard Gyroid Equation

The standard gyroid equation in Cartesian coordinates is:

G(x, y, z) = sin(x) · cos(y) + sin(y) · cos(z) + sin(z) · cos(x)

#### 5.3.2 Adapted Gyroid for Cylindrical Domain

For the cylindrical domain with variable frequency, the gyroid equation is adapted to:

G(r, θ, z) = sin(f(r) · r · cos(θ)) · cos(f(r) · r · sin(θ)) + 
             sin(f(r) · r · sin(θ)) · cos(f(r) · z) + 
             sin(f(r) · z) · cos(f(r) · r · cos(θ))

Where f(r) is the frequency gradient function:

f(r) = f_min + (f_0 - f_min) · ((R_outer - r)/(R_outer - R_inner))^α

#### 5.3.3 Frequency Parameters

- Reference frequency: f_0 = 2π/cell_size × 0.8378 = 0.7019 rad/mm
- Minimum frequency: f_min = f_0 × 0.1 = 0.0702 rad/mm
- Frequency gradient exponent: α = 0.3

### 5.4 Helical Tubes Mathematical Formulation

#### 5.4.1 Parametric Equation for Helix

For each tube i (where i ranges from 0 to 47):

- Angular offset: φᵢ = 2π × i / 48
- Helix equation:
  - x(t) = (coil_diameter/2) · cos(t + φᵢ)
  - y(t) = (coil_diameter/2) · sin(t + φᵢ)
  - z(t) = (pitch · t) / (2π)

Where:
- t is the parametric variable
- coil_diameter = 2 × inner_radius = 154.06 mm
- pitch = length / n_turns = 300 mm / 9.5 = 31.58 mm

#### 5.4.2 Distance Field Calculation

The distance field for the helical tubes is calculated as:

H(x, y, z) = min_{i=0..47} { min_{t} { √((x - x_i(t))² + (y - y_i(t))² + (z - z_i(t))²) } - tube_radius }

Where:
- (x_i(t), y_i(t), z_i(t)) is the position of tube i at parameter t
- tube_radius = 2.0 mm
